In an attempt to modernize, we are moving to new version of jQuery in our 
simple web project.  In the process of this upgrade we have broken the 
delete functionality on the default web page (Widget Manager).  The delete
button used to remove the widget from the page, but now it doesn't seem to 
be deleted (or at least there is nothing that happens on the UI).  When 
delete is clicked a second time, the page throws a warning that the item 
does not exist!  We need this page fixed ASAP.  The delete should still 
do an AJAX post when so the user does not loose their scroll position when 
the list of widgets gets long.

Feel free to make whatever changes you deem necessary to fix this page.
You should also ensure that all of the unit tests still pass when you 
are done (with changes if necessary).
